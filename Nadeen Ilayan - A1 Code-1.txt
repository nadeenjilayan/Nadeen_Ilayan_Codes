***Note: Please run each code separately, not all at once.  

Code 1: Q1 - Top flights - marketing
SELECT Year, Marketing_Airline_Network, COUNT(*) AS Total_Flights
FROM a1_carrier_bucket_nadeenilayan
GROUP BY Year, Marketing_Airline_Network

Code 2: Q1 - Top flights - operating
SELECT Year, operating_airline, COUNT(*) AS Total_Flights
FROM a1_carrier_bucket_nadeenilayan
GROUP BY Year, operating_airline
ORDER BY Year, Total_Flights DESC;

Code 3: Q2 - Code with missing data and wrong results
SELECT DayOfWeek, EXTRACT(HOUR FROM CAST(FlightDate AS timestamp)) AS Hour, AVG(DepDelayMinutes) AS Avg_Dep_Delay
FROM a1_carrier_bucket_nadeenilayan
GROUP BY DayOfWeek, EXTRACT(HOUR FROM CAST(FlightDate AS timestamp))
ORDER BY Avg_Dep_Delay ASC;

Code 4: Q2 - Average delays per weekdays
SELECT DayOfWeek,
